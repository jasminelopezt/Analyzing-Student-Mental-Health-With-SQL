# Analyzing-Student-Mental-Health-With-SQL

In this live code-along with DataCamp, I performed exploratory data analysis on a dataset around mental health of domestic and international students. 
I performed SQL querying to look at how social connectedness and cultural issues affect mental health.
Finally, I visualized the results of my analysis using the Python Plotly package.

## The Data

This survey was conducted in 2018 at an international Japanese university and the associated study was published in 2019. It was approved by several ethical and regulatory boards.

The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties compared to the general population, and that social connectedness and acculturative stress are predictive of depression.

Social connectedness: measure of belonging to a social group or network.

Acculturative stress: stress associated with learning about and intergrating into a new culture.
